# Litium Samples

## Important!

Read this before using code from this repository.

1. The samples are not supported by Litium
2. The samples are not maintained and updated when new versions of Litium are released
3. A sample may be created only as a demo and not for production use
4. The samples may not be tested thouroghly

However, with this in mind the samples can be used as inspiration or a starting point when implementing a specific solution in a project, just remember to test thouroghly before using the code in a production environment
